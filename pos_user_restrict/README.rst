Restriction of POS User
==================================================================

Allows setting the available Points of Sale for POS users and restricts access for other Points.



Restrictions work only for users with role **Point of Sale / User**.

After configuration, users will be able to see only the available Points of Sale and POS orders related to these Points.

Users with role **Point of Sale / Manager** can view all Points of Sale and all POS orders.


Configuration
=============

Goto **Settings** \> **Users** \> **Users**.

Choose the user and set available Points of Sale on tab **Point of Sale**.

In order for the restrictions to take effect, you must reassign the user role. Then return the previous role back.

 Or the administrator can restart the odoo-server service.
